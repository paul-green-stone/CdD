## Description

*CdD* is a dictionary data structure implemented in C, designed to facilitate quick access and management of key-value pairs. Leveraging a hash table under the hood, *CdD* offers constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making it an ideal choice for applications that require fast data retrieval. 

It's designed to work seamlessly on *\*nix* operating systems, including Linux and Unix. While *CdD* is not explicitly limited to these platforms, it has been developed and tested primarily in these environments.

### Features

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Framework for Custom Data Handling**: *CdD* provides a skeleton framework that requires users to define their own functions for handling the data stored in the dictionary. This allows for maximum flexibility and customization, enabling users to tailor the dictionary‚Äôs behavior to their specific application needs

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Fast Performance**: Utilizing a hash table under the hood, *CdD* provides constant-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making it an ideal choice for applications that demand quick data retrieval

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Memory Management**: While *CdD* efficiently manages its internal memory allocation and deallocation, users are responsible for implementing their own memory allocation and deallocation functions for the data types they store. Properly managing memory in these functions is crucial to prevent memory leaks


## Building

### Prerequisites

 To install and use *CdD*, you'll need the following:
 
 - A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
 - GNU Make utility
 - Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

 Follow these steps to install and set up *CdD* on your system:
 
 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**:
 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/paul-green-stone/CdD.git
 ```
 
 - 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Navigate to the project directory**:
 
 ```bash
 cd CdD
 ```
 
 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Build the libraries**:
 
Run make to compile the *CdD* library. This will generate both static and dynamic versions:

```bash
make
```

The make command will create the following libraries:

* `libCdD.a`: Static library
* `libCdD.so` or `libCdD.dylib`: Dynamic (shared) library

- **Include the header file**:

In your C project, include the `dictionary.h` header file to access the *CdD* API:

```C
#include "dictionary.h"
```

- **Link against the library**:

When compiling your project, link against the *CdD* library. If you're using the static library, link against `libCdD.a`. For the dynamic library, link against `libCdD.so` or `libCdD.dylib`. For example:

- Static library:

```bash
gcc -o your_program your_program.c /path/to/CdD/CdD.a
```
